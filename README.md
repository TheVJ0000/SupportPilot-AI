# SupportPilot AI

SupportPilot AI is a full-stack Generative AI customer-support platform being built as a personal portfolio project. It is designed to demonstrate production-minded RAG, bounded AI agents, full-stack application development, APIs, authentication, databases, automation, testing, security basics, and deployment.

## Planned capabilities

- Business authentication and isolated workspaces
- Support knowledge ingestion from documents and FAQs
- Workspace-scoped RAG with grounded answers and citations
- Hosted customer support chat with streaming responses
- Multi-turn conversations and customer feedback
- Safe insufficient-evidence handling
- Bounded Support Triage Agent for escalation workflows
- Admin views for conversations, feedback, sources, escalations, and basic analytics
- Embeddable website support widget

## Planned stack

**Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  
**Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Pydantic  
**Data:** Supabase PostgreSQL, Supabase Auth, Supabase Storage, pgvector  
**AI:** Gemini initially, RAG, Gemini embeddings, provider abstraction, LangGraph only where justified  
**Testing:** pytest, Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright, dedicated RAG evaluation cases

## Current status

**Phase 1 — frontend/backend application foundation.** The repository now includes a minimal React frontend that checks a FastAPI health endpoint. Authentication, data storage, AI, RAG, and other product functionality remain intentionally deferred to later roadmap phases.

The initial portfolio-development and public-demo target is **₹0 / $0 infrastructure and AI cost**, using suitable free tiers and replaceable providers.

## Documentation

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — persistent engineering rules
- [`docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`](docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md) — approved V1 product scope
- [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — planned system architecture and flows
- [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) — dependency-ordered development plan

## Security note

No production credentials, API keys, passwords, tokens, service-role credentials, or private keys belong in this repository. Real secrets must be supplied through environment variables or deployment secret stores. `.env.example` contains variable names only.

## Local development

The applications run locally without Docker, paid services, or external accounts. Expected addresses are:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Health endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health`

The defaults work without an environment file. To override local configuration, copy `.env.example` to `.env` at the repository root and set `FRONTEND_URL` and `VITE_API_BASE_URL`. Leave future Gemini and Supabase variables empty during this phase.

### Backend

Requires Python 3.12 or newer.

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the environment with `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` on Windows PowerShell or `source .venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux, then run:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Backend checks:

```bash
pytest
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
```

### Frontend

Requires Node.js 22.12 or newer.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend checks:

```bash
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
```
